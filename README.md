# **Car Price Prediction Project** 

This project aims to develop a model for predicting car prices based on various features. The model utilizes linear regression, a widely used algorithm for regression tasks.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information about different cars, including features such as company, body style, engine type, number of cylinders, wheel base, length, horsepower, and average mileage. The target variable is the price of the car.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

Before building the model, we conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the features and the target variable. We visualized the data using histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.

**Feature Engineering**

To prepare the data for modeling, we performed feature engineering. This involved encoding categorical variables using label encoding and selecting relevant features using the F-statistic. These steps helped us reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and focus on the most significant features.

**Model Development**

We trained a linear regression model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set. The model learned patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable. We used mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared) as metrics to assess the model's accuracy.

**Results and Conclusion**

The developed car price prediction model achieved a 89% of accuracy in estimating car prices. 
This project provides valuable insights into car pricing strategies and can assist in decision-making within the automotive industry.

**Conclusion**

In this car price prediction project, we developed a linear regression model to estimate car prices based on various features. The model showed promising results in predicting car prices with reasonable accuracy. This project provides valuable insights for pricing strategies and decision-making in the automotive industry.
